Task

1. Declare a constant variable, PI, and assign it the value Math.PI. You will not pass this challenge unless the variable is declared as a constant and named PI (uppercase).
2. Read a number, r, denoting the radius of a circle from stdin.
3. Use PI and r to calculate the area and perimeter of a circle having radius r.
4. Print area as the first line of output and print perimeter as the second line of output.

Input Format:
A single integer, r, denoting the radius of a circle.

Constraints:
0 < r <= 100
r is a floating-point number scaled to at most 3 decimal places.

Output Format:
Print the following two lines:
1. On the first line, print the area of the circle having radius r.
2. On the second line, print the perimeter of the circle having radius r.

Sample Input 0:
2.6

Sample Output 0:
21.237166338267002
16.336281798666924

Explanation 0:

Given the radius r=2.6, we calculate the following:
area = PI * sqr(r) = 21.237166338267002
perimeter = 2 * PI * r = 16.336281798666924
We then print area as our first line of output and perimeter as our second line of output.
